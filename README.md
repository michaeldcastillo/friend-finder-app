# FriendFinder

### Project Description

This project takes its inspiration from the increasing popularity of online dating sites. In this example, the app is a "full-stack" web application. This site takes in results from a user survey and then compares the answers with those from other users -- looking for the closest match (least difference in answers). The app then displays the name and picture of the existing user who best matches with the current user.

Technologies used in this app include the following:

* JavaScript - As a "full-stack" programming language (w/jQuery library and Bootstrap CSS framework)
* Node.js - JavaScript runtime
* Express.js (package) - Node package used to create a web server
* Heroku - Web hosting platform
